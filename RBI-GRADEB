> Most toppers score high in **GA (60+ / 80)** because Quant & Reasoning are time-consuming.

Hence—always give 45 min/day minimum for GK.

---

Would you like me to turn this entire plan (with cutoff, time slots, Oct 10–31 day-wise plan, and checklist) into a **printable PDF study calendar** that you can tick daily?
🔥 Perfect question, Asmi — because **GK / Current Affairs (80 marks)** is **the game changer** in RBI Grade B Phase 1.

👉 Most toppers score **50–65 marks** here, while average aspirants stay stuck at **25–35** — even if they study the same PDFs.
So, let’s decode **how YOU can reach 50+ in GK** — step by step.

---

## 🎯 GOAL: 50+ / 80 Marks in GA Section (RBI Grade B Phase 1)

To hit that safely, you need to:

> **Attempt ~65 questions** (out of 80)
> **Get 55+ correct** → ~50–52 marks after negative marking

---

## 🧠 FIRST: UNDERSTAND THE PATTERN (80 Questions Breakdown)

| Type                                              | Approx. Qs | Example                           | Source to Cover                   |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| 📰 **Current Affairs (National + International)** | 35–40      | Awards, Appointments, Summits     | AffairsCloud Daily + Monthly PDF  |
| 🏦 **Banking & Financial Awareness**              | 15–20      | Repo Rate, RBI Circulars, Schemes | RBI site + AffairsCloud + GKToday |
| 📈 **Economic & Social Schemes / Reports**        | 10–12      | PM Schemes, UN Reports            | PIB + AC Monthly Capsule          |
| 🌎 **Static GK (States, Dams, Parks)**            | 5–7        | Tiger Reserve in X State          | AC Static Capsule                 |
| 🧾 **Miscellaneous (Books, Days, Sports)**        | 5–6        | World Book Day, ICC Trophies      | AffairsCloud Monthly PDF          |

💡 **So 60%+ of GA = Current Affairs + Economy.**
That’s where your focus must be laser-sharp.

---

## 🗓️ STEP 1: FIX YOUR GK SOURCES (No jumping)

Use **only these 3** — don’t touch anything else:

1. 🗞️ **AffairsCloud Daily PDF + Monthly Capsule** → Primary
2. 📊 **GKToday Weekly Quiz** → Practice
3. 💰 **RBI Official Site (News section)** → 5-min weekly check

That’s it.

---

## 🗓️ STEP 2: FOLLOW THIS DAILY–WEEKLY–MONTHLY FLOW

### 🔹 DAILY (15–20 mins)

* Read **AffairsCloud Daily PDF** (current affairs headlines + economy news)
* Highlight:

  * Government schemes (esp. MoF, RBI, SEBI)
  * Index/Reports (e.g. HDI, GII, CPI)
  * Appointments, Awards, Sports, Books
  * Banking: repo/reverse rate, inflation, GDP updates

📓 Maintain a “GA Notebook” (month-wise, 4 pages/month max)
Write only **short keywords**:

> “Oct – Repo ↑ 6.5%, new Deputy Governor: X, G20 Summit: Delhi, Theme: Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam.”

---

### 🔹 WEEKLY (1 hr on Sunday)

* Revise the **past 7 days of PDFs**
* Take **AffairsCloud Weekly Quiz** (100 Qs)
* Mark your score (aim for 60+ correct)
* Re-read your mistakes

💡 You’ll retain 70% just by **revising weekly once**.

---

### 🔹 MONTHLY (4th week)

* Read **AffairsCloud Monthly PDF + Q&A PDF**
* Attempt their **Monthly Quiz Section** (400–500 Qs)
* Revise your **GA Notebook** notes once

---

## 🧩 STEP 3: TARGET MOST-ASKED TOPICS

Here’s what repeats **every year** 👇

| Topic                    | Weightage | Tip                                                         |
| ------------------------ | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| RBI Reports, Circulars   | 5–7 Qs    | Read last 6 months RBI updates (Monetary Policy, FSR, etc.) |
| Government Schemes       | 10–12 Qs  | Focus on 1-year schemes (PM Vishwakarma, Jal Jeevan, etc.)  |
| Indices & Reports        | 6–8 Qs    | Note rank + index + organization                            |
| Budget & Economic Survey | 6–8 Qs    | Read AffairsCloud summary PDF                               |
| Appointments & Awards    | 5–7 Qs    | Highlight only key ones                                     |
| Sports & Books           | 4–5 Qs    | Focus on winners + event venue                              |
| Banking Awareness        | 10+ Qs    | Repo rate, SLR, CRR, Inflation, Balance of Payment basics   |

---

## 🧠 STEP 4: SMART REVISION STRATEGY (No mugging)

Use the **3-2-1 rule**:

* Read once (Daily PDF)
* Revise twice (Weekly + Monthly)
* Recall once (Mock/Quiz)

By 3rd reading, your retention = **90%+**

---

## 📅 STEP 5: 6-MONTH COVERAGE WINDOW

> RBI GA questions mostly come from the **past 6 months before exam month.**

So if exam = June 2025,
📘 Cover **Dec 2024 – May 2025 AffairsCloud PDFs** only.

Don’t waste time on old 2023 news — unless for schemes continuing this year.

---

## ⚙️ STEP 6: TEST YOURSELF REGULARLY

| Frequency              | Task                        | Source                           |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Every Sunday           | Weekly GK Quiz              | AffairsCloud / GKToday           |
| 15th & 30th each month | Full GA Mock                | Oliveboard (Free Sectional)      |
| After 3 months         | Compile 1500 Q Revision PDF | AffairsCloud “Quarterly” Capsule |

👉 *Scoring 60+ consistently in these free quizzes = 50+ in actual exam.*

---

## 💡 STEP 7: FINAL MONTH REVISION TRICK

* Prepare 20 “Mini Revision Sheets” (A4 size)

  * Month name on top
  * 1 page = top 50 one-liners
* Read 2 sheets daily before sleeping in last 20 days.

This single habit alone helps push you from **35 → 50+ marks**.

## 🔥 BONUS: YOUR “GK STUDY FORMULA”

```
Daily: 20 mins (AffairsCloud Daily PDF)
Weekly: 1 hr (Quiz + Revise)
Monthly: 3 hrs (Full Capsule)
Last 1 Month: 1 hr/day revision + mock GK
```

**Total GK time investment:** ~6 hrs/week
**Expected return:** 50–60 marks in Phase 1 🔥

---

## ⚠️ DON’T DO THESE MISTAKES

🚫 Don’t read from 4–5 websites → stick to one (AffairsCloud).
🚫 Don’t memorize; **understand linkages** (e.g., Repo rate → Inflation).
🚫 Don’t skip weekly revision — retention drops drastically.
🚫 Don’t ignore RBI-specific news (Appointments, Reports, Circulars).
