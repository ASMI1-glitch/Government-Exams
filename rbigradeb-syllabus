Would you like me to now:

* 🔹 Convert this into a **section-wise printable study planner (PDF)**,
* 🔹 Include **“topics checklist”** under each subject (so you can tick off what’s done),
* 🔹 Add **direct clickable free resource links (AffairsCloud, EduTap YT, Oliveboard mocks)**,
  and
* 🔹 Break the first 8 weeks (Oct–Nov) into a **weekly routine table**?

It’ll look like your **“RBI Grade B Master Tracker Booklet.”**
Should I generate that next?
